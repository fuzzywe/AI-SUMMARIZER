AI article summarizers often struggle with HTML content due to several technical challenges. Here are key reasons why they might not perform well:

1. HTML Noise

HTML tags and metadata add non-essential content that summarizers must filter out.

Tags like <div>, <span>, and inline CSS or JavaScript can confuse text extraction processes.


2. Structured vs. Unstructured Data

Summarizers are designed for natural language processing (NLP) of plain text.

HTML documents mix text with structured elements, requiring extra parsing before summarization.


3. Content Segmentation

HTML pages often have menus, sidebars, ads, and comments that are irrelevant for summarization.

Extracting the main content (body text) without processing irrelevant sections is a challenge.


4. Dynamic Content

Some pages load additional content dynamically via JavaScript, which static summarizers may miss.


5. Incomplete Parsing

Without proper HTML parsing techniques, tools may not detect headings, paragraphs, and contextual relationships correctly.


Solutions for Better Summarization

1. Pre-process the HTML using libraries like BeautifulSoup (Python) or Cheerio (Node.js) to extract relevant text.


2. Use Content Detection Algorithms like Boilerpipe or Mercury to strip unnecessary elements.


3. Leverage NLP models fine-tuned for summarizing web page content.
